One possible reason why your Far Cry 6 game might fail to launch is that you do not have enough permissions to run the game files on your system. To fix this issue, you can try to grant administrative privileges to both the game executable file (FarCry6.exe) and the game launcher that you use (either Ubisoft Connect or Epic Games Launcher). To do this, you need to right-click on the file icon, select Properties, go to the Compatibility tab, and check the box that says "Run this program as an administrator". Then click Apply and OK. This will allow the game and the launcher to access the necessary resources and settings to run properly.

If running the game and the launcher as an administrator does not solve the problem, you might need to check if your system meets the minimum requirements to play Far Cry 6. You can find the system requirements on the official website of the game or on the store page of the launcher. Compare them with your system specifications and see if you need to upgrade any components or settings. For example, you might need to update your graphics card driver, install the latest DirectX version, or adjust your screen resolution.
  
Another possible cause of the game not starting is that some files are corrupted or missing. This can happen due to incomplete installation, disk errors, or malware infection. To fix this issue, you can try to verify the integrity of the game files using the launcher. This will scan the game folder and detect any damaged or missing files and replace them with fresh ones. To do this, you need to open the launcher, go to your game library, select Far Cry 6, and click on the Verify Files button. Wait for the process to complete and then try to launch the game again.
  
If none of the above solutions work, you might need to contact the game support team for further assistance. You can find their contact information on the official website of the game or on the launcher. You can also check their online forums and FAQs for more tips and troubleshooting guides. Make sure to provide them with as much information as possible about your system and the issue you are facing. They might ask you to send them some screenshots or log files to help them diagnose and resolve the problem.
